# gatsby-starter-epic

Gatsby starter with good, opinionated defaults. I use it for most projects.

It includes my favourite dependencies, dev tools, configurations, and the like.
## Features
### Tech stack

A complete list of dependencies is in `package.json`. These are the primary ones:

#### Core

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

#### Development

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) (testing framework)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (testing library)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) (linting)
- [eslint-config-airbnb-typescript](https://github.com/iamturns/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript) (primary ESLint config extension)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) (code formatter)
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) (precommit validation)

#### Styles

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.co) (CSS framework)
- [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) (CSS-in-JS for Tailwind)
- [Emotion Styled Components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) (styled components for use with `twin.macro`)
- [postcss](https://postcss.org) (CSS customisation)
- [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) (removes unused CSS)

- [Inter UI font](https://rsms.me/inter/) (sleek, modern Sans font)
#### Misc

- [lodash](https://lodash.com) (general utilities)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) (error logging)

### Other features

* Dev workflow works smoothly out of the box
* Absolute imports are configured
* Extra Tailwind CSS utilities (text shadows)
* Great TypeScript config defaults
* Jest config and utilities for writing clean tests
* Simple examples for writing clean, maintainable tests
* Optimised ESLint config (including adjustments to the extensions)
* `global.css` for any global styles that can't be included in `tailwind.config.js`
* Organised directory tree
* Example of a page with its own folder
* [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for consistent styles across multiple editors
* VSCode config that works out of the box with `twin.macro`
* `.env.example` file
* `uuid` utility for `key` props (useful when an ID from a back-end isn't available)

No state management is includedâ€”only dependencies for the UI. This enables you to configure the project for any state management library (or none at all).

Examples will be included for Apollo/Redux later (or feel free to open a PR if you get around to it before me). I'm thinking of using an automated setup script instead of creating multiple redundant repos for each one. It will automatically add/overwrite necessary files for whatever config you choose and work flawlessly out of the box.
## ðŸš€ Installation

Copy environment variable template:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the env vars as necessary for your environment.

Then install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Development

Run the dev server:

```sh
yarn run develop -p 3000
```

Now open `http://localhost:3000` to view the site. Any changes will be updated in real-time.

Of course, you can redact `-p 3000` if you always use this by default.

I also recommend installing [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) for style autocompletion.

### Utilities

```sh
yarn run test
yarn run test:watch # Run in watch mode
```

Lint the source code:

```sh
yarn run lint
yarn run lint:fix # Fix any possible errors
```

Format the source code:

```sh
yarn run prettier
yarn run prettier:fix # Fix any possible errors
```

Validate the source code with `lint`, `prettier`, & `test`:

```sh
yarn run validate
```

Build the source code:

```sh
yarn run build
```

Run the built source code in the browser:

```sh
yarn run serve
```

Install Husky Git hooks:

```sh
yarn install-hooks
```
## Deployment

Validate and build the source code for deployment:

```sh
yarn run deploy
